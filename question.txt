Question 1: What authentication scheme is used by default in Django 
    Rest Framework's browsable API? How is this managed?

   -it uses basic auth and session auth
   -we can manage which authentication scheme by adding more scheme to authlath/setting.py under
    Rest_Framework
     


Question 2: What authentication scheme is 
    used by httpie when querying with the -a or --auth option flag?
    - it uses basic auth. we can type in super username and password

Question 3: What is the difference between Session Authentication and Token Authentication? How is 
Token Authentication an improvement over Basic Authentication?
    - session auth is managed by the server side; once we log in we dont have to log in again
      if we log in before session time interval.
    - for token auth, token are given and the user need to store them. so the security is
      dependant on the user keeping this token safe

    -improvement of token auth is that it is more secure because tokens are unique.
    
Question 4: Provide a high level summary of what happens during an OAuth2 authentication flow. For instance: bitbucket.org > Log In > Log in with Google. 
What happens when I click "Log in with Google"?

     1.the app request to access the resource from the User
     2.the user will say ok and give the app the authorization grants
     3.app will use this authorization grant + its identity
       to ask google server for an access token
     4. the google server will give the app the access token
     5. the app then can use this access token to get protected data 
        from the google api    

Question 5: Please provide a link to your code.
